# Information Security Strategy Development Playbook (Regulated Environments)

This repository documents a practical information security strategy and controls playbook designed for regulated operational environments. It demonstrates risk based thinking, control mapping, and audit ready documentation, written to be understandable by both technical and non technical stakeholders.

## What this repository contains

Start here: open the overview report in `evidence/report/`, then the detailed report.

Key artefacts are stored under `evidence/`:

- `evidence/report/` contains two reports
  - Overview report: a concise summary of the strategy, risks, and recommended controls
  - Detailed report: deeper analysis covering controls, governance considerations, and implementation guidance
- `evidence/slides/` contains supporting presentation material (if included)
- `evidence/screenshots/` contains verification screenshots (if included)
- `docs/` contains any supporting diagrams or documentation notes (if included)

Note: organisation specific sensitive information is excluded. The focus is on transferable security strategy methods, control thinking, and verification ready documentation.

## What this work demonstrates

This work demonstrates how I:
1. Identify and prioritise security risks in real operational contexts
2. Translate risks into practical safeguards and controls across people, process, and technology
3. Align controls to GDPR aware and compliance minded delivery expectations
4. Produce documentation that supports auditability and reviewer verification

## How to verify quickly

1. Start in `evidence/report/` and open the overview report first
2. Review the detailed report for full control mapping and recommendations
3. Check `evidence/slides/` for a high level walkthrough (if present)
4. Check `evidence/screenshots/` for quick verification extracts (if present)
